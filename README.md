## Simple Blog with Posts

For study purposes I've created a simple blog structure where you can Login with you Facebook Account and write simple posts and post it.

In this project I'm using:

[Next.js](https://nextjs.org/)<br/>
[React Bootstrap](https://react-bootstrap.github.io/)<br/>
[MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/1)<br/>
[Next Auth](https://next-auth.js.org/)<br/>


P.S.: You will need to create a DB called 'postDB', have a Facebook ID and a Facebook Secret in order to make it work in a local server.
